      An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand
      (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). Entities are frequently used to display
      reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code),
      and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them
      in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard
      keyboard. Note: Many characters have memorable entities. For example, the
      entity for the copyright symbol (©) is &copy;. For less memorable
      characters, such as &#8212; or &#x2014;, you can use a reference chart or
      decoder tool. Reserved characters Some special characters are reserved for
      use in HTML, meaning that your browser will parse them as HTML code. For
      example, if you use the less-than sign, the browser interprets any text
      that follows as a tag. To display these characters as text, replace them
      with their corresponding character entities, as shown in the following
      table.
